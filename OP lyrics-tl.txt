I wanna fall in love.
I wanna fall in love.

納棺夢が続く
The dreams of encoffinning continue.
約束しても　心がどこかで怯えてるみたい
Even though I promise, my heart still fears something.
一人じゃないって　信じたいのに
I really want to believe that I'm not alone.
思い続けてるだけで　幸せなんて言えないね
I guess you can't really call just thinking about it happiness.

虚ろな自信　背負っていても　君が笑う
Even burdened with empty confidence, you laugh. (It's not stated that it's the speaker's confidence so I'm erring on the ambiguous side)
そして私の勇気になる
And then, you become my courage.
一つの言葉で　君の世界を変えられたら　二つの恋が進化する
If one word can change your world, then the love of two will evolve.

ホントだよ
It's true.
巡らせた迷いが見つけた答えはいつでも君に導かれた
You were always the one who lead me to the answer when I let confusion invade.

届ける覚悟が様にならなくても素直に伝えたい
Even if I never ready enough to tell you, I want you to know.
心あるがまま　声がきらめく
My voice glitters, conveying just as my heart feels
With the voice 響き渡るよ
With the voice, it echos, you know.
